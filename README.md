# CNN for Image Classification

## Project Overview
This project builds a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image classification tasks. CNNs are widely used in computer vision for tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and image classification due to their ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies from images.

## Key Features
- Implements a custom **CNN architecture** to classify images into various categories.
- Utilizes **data preprocessing** techniques like normalization and augmentation to improve model performance.
- Evaluates model accuracy and performance using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, and **recall**.
- Visualizes training progress and classification results to gain insights into model performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for development.
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for building and training the CNN model.
- **NumPy** for data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib** for visualizing model performance and predictions.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a reliable CNN-based classifier for images, demonstrating the effectiveness of convolutional layers in learning spatial features from image data.
